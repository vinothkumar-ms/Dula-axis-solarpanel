🚀 Project Title: Dual Axis Solar Tracker (Day 2)

This project is part of my daily learning series where I explore electronics design through practical builds.

On Day 2, I completed the schematic design of a Dual Axis Solar Tracker using KiCad. This system uses two LDR sensors and two DC motors to automatically align a solar panel for maximum sunlight capture. The core control is done using an ATmega328P, with a L293D motor driver handling motor actuation.

Technologies Used:

KiCad (Schematic Design)

Embedded Hardware (ATmega328P, L293D)

Analog Sensing (LDR)

Power Regulation (7805)

🛠️ Stay tuned for PCB layout and code implementation in the next phase!

📌 Repo includes schematic files, images, and poster for documentation.
